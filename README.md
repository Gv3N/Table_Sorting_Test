 You are to implement a simple sorting function:
 1. Create a HTML page with 3 textboxes, 1 button and 1 dropdown (refer to the image above)
 2. UserID textbox value has to be:
    - Automatically generated
    - Unique, starts with 1
    - Not user changeable
 3. UserName and UserOccupation textboxes input name and occupation
 4. When users click on Add button, both textboxes values need to be added into a data structure of your own design
 5. Dropdown contains UserID, UserName and UserOccupation for selecting your sorting preferences
 6. Bonus point if you have high code quality (readable and easily maintainable code), relevant comments, optimization,usage of jQuery, event delegation, etc
